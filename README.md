🎮 Pro Tic Tac Toe – Interactive Android Game
📌 Project Overview

Pro Tic Tac Toe is a modern, responsive, and interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows two players to play alternately on the same device, with real-time score tracking, theme switching, and animated win effects.
